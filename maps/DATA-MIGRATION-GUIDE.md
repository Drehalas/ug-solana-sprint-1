# Data Folder Consolidation and Map Separation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the changes made to consolidate all data folders into a common structure and outlines the steps to complete the migration process. It also includes guidance on separating the map functionality into a separate project.

## Changes Completed

### Data Folder Consolidation

✅ Created a new centralized data folder structure:
```
components/
  data/
    README.md          - Documentation for the new structure
    USAGE-EXAMPLE.tsx  - Example component showing how to use the new data structure
    about/             - About page data
    charities/         - Charities data
    contact/           - Contact page data
    dashboard/         - Dashboard data
    donate/            - Donation data
```

✅ Migrated all data files from component-specific folders to the new centralized structure

## Benefits of the New Structure

- **Centralized Data Management**: All data is now in one location, making it easier to find and update
- **Consistent Structure**: Each data domain follows the same pattern with data files and type definitions
- **Simplified Imports**: Components can import data from a consistent location
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to data structure only need to be made in one place

## Next Steps to Complete Migration

### 1. Update Component Imports

Update all components that import data from the old structure to use the new centralized data folder. For example:

```typescript
// Old import
import { teamData } from '../About/data/data';

// New import
import { teamData } from '../data/about/data';
```

Refer to the `USAGE-EXAMPLE.tsx` file for examples of how to update imports.

### 2. Remove Old Data Folders

Once all components have been updated to use the new data structure, you can safely remove the old data folders:

- `components/About/data/`
- `components/Charities/data/`
- `components/Contact/data/`
- `components/Dashboard/data/`
- `components/Donate/data/`

### 3. Test the Application

After updating all imports and removing old data folders, thoroughly test the application to ensure everything works correctly.

## Map Functionality Separation

A detailed guide for separating the map functionality into a separate project has been created in `MAP-SEPARATION-GUIDE.md`. This guide includes:

- Step-by-step instructions for creating a new project
- List of files to copy to the new project
- Configuration updates needed
- Testing procedures

Refer to this guide when you're ready to separate the map functionality.

## Refactoring Plan

A comprehensive refactoring plan has been created in `REFACTORING-PLAN.md`. This document outlines:

- The overall strategy for data consolidation
- The approach for map functionality separation
- Implementation steps and timeline

## Conclusion

The data folder consolidation is now partially complete. The new structure has been created and all data files have been migrated. To complete the migration, you need to update component imports and remove the old data folders.

The map functionality separation can be done following the detailed guide in `MAP-SEPARATION-GUIDE.md`.

These changes will improve the maintainability and organization of your codebase while preserving the map functionality for future reference.
